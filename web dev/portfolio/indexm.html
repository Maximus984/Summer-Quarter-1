                    <p>Free-to-Play: Unlike the original, anyone can download and play it for free. It's supported by a seasonal battle pass and a shop for cosmetic items.
5v5 Gameplay: Teams were reduced from six players to five (one Tank, two Damage, two Support), making for faster-paced and more dynamic matches.
Hero Shooter: You choose from a diverse roster of unique heroes, each with their own special abilities, and work with your team to complete objectives.
Live Service Game: It receives regular seasonal updates that add new heroes, maps, game modes, and cosmetic content to keep the experience fresh.</p>
