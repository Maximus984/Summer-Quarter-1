# 1. Create a list of 5 of your favorite snacks
# 2. Create a tuple of 5 colleges you want to attend
# 3. Create a set of with 5 pieces of data on anything you want;
# 4. Create a dictionary on a car; key must describe an attribute of the car, followed it's value.
# 5. Once your data structures are created, change a value in all the structures that are mutable.
# You add, or subtract, or move, data within each structure.
# (Pay attention to which data structures are mutable.
# Once done, print all your data structures to the console.
